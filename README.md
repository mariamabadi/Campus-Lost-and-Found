# M.A.R.S Campus-Lost-and-Found
**Live site:**  https://campus-lost-and-found-pink-six.vercel.app
React + Tailwind CSS + React Router. Frontend-only application using mock data.

## Project Topic and Entities

The project topic is Campus Lost & Found. It allows students to report lost or found items across campus buildings and claim their belongings.

The main entities are:
- Items
- Locations
- Claims
- Users

## How Mock Data Simulates CRUD

The application uses mock data to simulate CRUD operations. Users can add, edit, and delete items through the interface.

All data (items, claims, users and locations) lives in React state through the shared `DataContext`, so a change on one page shows up on every other page while the app is running. Refreshing the page resets everything to the original mock data in `src/data/mockData.js`.

## Run Locally

To run the project locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Routes (`src/App.jsx`)

| Path | Page | File |
|------|------|------|
| `/` | Home | `pages/Home.jsx` |
| `/items` | Item List | `pages/ItemList.jsx` |
| `/items/new` | Report an Item | `pages/ItemForm.jsx` |
| `/items/:id` | Item Details | `pages/ItemDetail.jsx` |
| `/items/:id/edit` | Edit Item | `pages/ItemForm.jsx` |
| `/claims/:id` | Claim Details | `pages/ClaimDetail.jsx` |
| `/locations/:id` | Location Details | `pages/LocationDetail.jsx` |
| `/login` | Login | `pages/Login.jsx` |
| `/register` | Register | `pages/Register.jsx` |
| `/dashboard` | My Dashboard | `pages/Dashboard.jsx` |
| `/report` | Redirects to `/items/new` | |
| `*` | 404 Page | `pages/NotFound.jsx` |

## Shared Tools

- **Data:** `useData()` from `context/DataContext.jsx` provides access to items, users, claims, and locations.
- **Login State:** `useAuth()` from `context/AuthContext.jsx` provides:
  `{ currentUser, login(email, password), logout(), register(form), emailExists(email) }`.
  The `login` function returns the user or `null` if the email or password is incorrect.
  Demo accounts are available in `mockData.js` (password: `password123`).
- **Theme:** `useTheme()` from `context/ThemeContext.jsx` provides `{ theme, toggleTheme }`.
  Use `dark:` classes to support dark mode.
- **Colors:** Defined in `src/index.css`, based on the project palette:
  - `brand-50` to `brand-950` (greens, with `brand-800` = `#244B3C`)
  - `cream` (`#F7F5EC`)
  - `line` (`#DCE6D8`)
  - `ink` (headings)
  - `body` (text)
  - `muted` (`#68796C`)
  - `night-700` to `night-950` (dark mode)

Ready-made classes include: `btn-primary`, `btn-secondary`, `btn-danger`, `btn-danger-outline`, `card`, `form-label`, `form-input`, `form-error`, `display`, `eyebrow`, `pill`, and `pill-active`.

## Deployment

The project includes `vercel.json` (Vercel) and `public/_redirects` (Netlify) to redirect routes to `index.html`. This allows pages such as `/items/3` to work when refreshed.
